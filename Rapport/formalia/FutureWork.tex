\section{Usertests}
Conducting usertests of the language could further improve the usability of the language and lead to discovery of errors that has not been found yet. When doing a test with testpersons who hasn't been involved in the creation process you get a new point of view, which gives completely different problems compared to when the creators of the language use it. 
A view of conducting a test with external users is to do an usability evaluation where a set of testpersons receive tasks to perform using our language. While solving the tasks the testpersons will tell what they do giving a new insight in the functionality and usability of the language. 
After the evaluation a prioritized list of problems will be made and this gives a base for continuing development of the language.

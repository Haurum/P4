Error handling - evt. med en error stack ?
Vi kunne have haft ét symbol table?
Generelt hvad vi har opnået


In section \ref{sec:MoSCoW} the MoSCoW analysis was created and described. The method was used to prioritize the requirements for the project's language. Table \ref{moscowDis} shows which of the requirements that have been implemented and which have not been implemented. \newline
All \textit{Must have} requirements has been implemented as they should, since these were the most important and essential requirements for the language. These were needed to make the logic, movement etc., for the robot. \newline
All \textit{Should have} requirements has also been implemented. The Events and Void and type methods helps the users in order to make more intelligent robots, where Comments are useful for the readability of the program, made by the user. \newline
Most of the requirements in \textit{Could have}, has been implemented, which is Print statements, Strings and Setup block. Print statements and Strings have been implemented for the user to be able to debug their code. The Setup block is used for code, that should only be run once each round. Here the user could write code to make some initializing movements e.g. make the  robot move to the wall. Cos, Sin \& Tan and For loops were not implemented in DatLanguage. \newline
None of the requirements from \textit{Won't have} were implemented in this project.

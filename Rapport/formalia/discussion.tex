Error handling - evt. med en error stack ?
Vi kunne have haft ét symbol table?
Tjekke efter moscow,
Generelt hvad vi har opnået


In section \ref{sec:MoSCoW} the MoSCoW analysis was created and describes. This was used to prioritize the requirements for the projects language. In table \ref{moscowDis} shows what have been implemented and what have not been implemented. \newline
All \textit{Must have} items have been implemented as they should, since these was the most important and essential items for the language. These items was needed to make the logic, movement and so on for the robot. \newline
All \textit{Should have} items have also been implemented. The Events and Void and type methods helps making more intelligent robots, where Comments will help for the readability of the program the user makes. \newline
Half of the items in \textit{Could have}, has been implemented, which is Print statements, Strings and Setup block. Print statements and Strings have been implemented for the user to be able to debug their code. The Setup block is used for code, that should only be run once each round. Here the user could write code to make some initializing movements e.g. make the  robot move to the wall. Cos, Sin \& Tan, For loops and Arrays were not implemented in DatLanguage. \newline
No items from \textit{Won't have} were implemented to this project.

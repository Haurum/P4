This project approaches the fourth semester project regarding creating a domain specific language for programming Robocode, that is aimed at high school students, without knowledge of programming, in order to introduce programming to students, at an early stage. \newline

The group approached the project by creating a domain specific language that is somehow similar to the programming language Java, but with some meaningful changes. \newline

This domain specific language compiles the robots that has been created to a java file, which then compiles it yet another time, this time into the executable Robocode file.

\section{Grammar}

\subsection{Lexicon}
The definition of what input are allowed for each lexical in the grammar is defined by regular expressions. This will be described here with a table of terminals with matching regex. A stream of characters is read by the scanner of the compiler and then turned into a lexical defined by the regex.
